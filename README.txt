Hippocampal‚ÄìPrefrontal Orchestration Supports Higher-Order Learning for Creative Ideation

This repository contains the complete analysis pipeline used in our study investigating how hippocampal‚Äìprefrontal interactions and representational dimensionality reduction support higher-order learning and creative ideation.  

It integrates:  
- **Behavioral analyses (R)** for prediction error, imitation‚Äìcreation trade-off, and memory effects.  
- **fMRI analyses (Python)** for dimensionality, representational similarity, connectivity, transfer, and decoding.  
- **Multivariate analyses (MATLAB)** using CoSMoMVPA and CANlab for RSA, searchlight decoding, and mediation.

All scripts are organized into modules, each corresponding to specific analyses reported in the study.

üòä Behavioral Analyses (R)

R scripts implement trial-level and subject-level models of prediction error, imitation, memory, and creativity.

- **1predicErrorMemoryGLLM.R**  
  - GLMM testing whether prediction errors improve exemplar memory.  
  - Input: trial-level memory accuracy (binary) + prediction error index.  
  - Output: fixed/random effects of prediction error on memory.  

- **2predicErrorCreativeLMM.R**  
  - LMM testing prediction error effects on creative ideation ratings.  
  - Input: trial-level creativity score (Likert scale) + prediction error index.  
  - Output: model coefficients predicting creativity.  

- **3predicErrorImitate.R**  
  - Assesses prediction error influence on exemplar imitation behavior.  
  - Input: similarity ratings between generated ideas and exemplars.  
  - Output: probability of imitation given prediction error.  

- **4ImatationMemorCreat.R**  
  - Examines how imitation relates to memory and creativity simultaneously.  
  - Input: imitation index, memory performance, creativity scores.  
  - Output: correlation and regression results.  

- **5ImatitionMedatingCreat.R / 6ImitationMediatingMemor.R**  
  - Mediation models: imitation as mediator for creativity or memory outcomes.  
  - Input: PE ‚Üí imitation ‚Üí creativity/memory.  
  - Output: mediation path coefficients, bootstrap CIs.  

- **7PredicError_tradeoff.R**  
  - Trade-off model quantifying how prediction error shifts balance between memory and creativity.  
  - Output: trade-off index (memory vs originality).  

- **8tradeoffMemoryGLMM.R / 9tradeoffMediatingMemor.R**  
  - GLMM/mediation of trade-off effects specifically on memory outcomes.  

- **SeriesPositionEffectAnalysis.R**  
  - Tests whether serial order of exemplars influences creativity and memory.
