This directory contains the analysis code for Supplementary Experiment S2, described in the manuscript (result. S10, table S3; fig. S9).
The aim of Exp. S2 was to directly examine hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to exemplar memory (SME), contrasting with creative ideation (SCE).

Background

In Exp. 1, the self-creating task likely interfered with exemplar memory, limiting precise assessment of SME.

Exp. S2 replaced the self-creating phase with a cued-recall memory test immediately after exemplar learning.

Exemplar-learning trials were classified as Remembered or Forgotten based on cued recall accuracy.

Neural comparisons were conducted between Remembered vs Forgotten items, focusing on:

-Hippocampal univariate activation

-Hippocampal global pattern similarity

-Hippocampal representational dimensionality

-Hippocampalâ€“vlPFC representational connectivity
